## Andrew Fahmy (ajfahmy)

In the most recent commit, Andrew added 2 files: hw1.Rmd and hw1.html.
The commit ID is 68196f5598ac366cc2d83589e0b3b19e5491249c.

I did not encounter any errors while knitting Andrew's hw1.Rmd file.

A tip for making Git/GitHub easier to learn and operate is don't be afraid to ask questions, especially if you are new to the program. I had lots of questions but I feel much more confident now having asked questions when I was confused than I would be if I had tried to figure everything out by myself.
